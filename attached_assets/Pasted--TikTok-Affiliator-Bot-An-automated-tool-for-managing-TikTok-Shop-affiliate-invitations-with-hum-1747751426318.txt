# TikTok Affiliator Bot

An automated tool for managing TikTok Shop affiliate invitations with human-like behavior.

## Overview

This bot automates the process of sending affiliate program invitations to TikTok creators. It uses advanced browser automation with human-like behavior patterns to avoid detection while managing your TikTok Shop affiliate program.

## Features

- **Human-like Behavior**: Random delays, natural mouse movements, and variable scrolling to mimic human interaction
- **Session Management**: Save and load sessions to avoid repeated logins
- **Automatic Invitation**: Create and manage multiple affiliate invitation links
- **Creator Filtering**: Filter potential affiliates by follower count, engagement rate, and other metrics
- **Anti-Detection**: Uses undetected ChromeDriver to bypass TikTok's bot detection mechanisms
- **Configurable Settings**: Easily adjust behavior parameters and thresholds via config file

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Chrome browser installed
- Stable internet connection
- TikTok Seller account with Shop enabled

```

3. Install the required packages:

# Login to TikTok Seller Center
bot.login()

# Navigate to affiliate program section
bot.navigate_to_affiliate_program()

# Create invitation links
links = bot.create_invitation_links(base_name="Spring2025Campaign", count=5)

# Search for potential creators based on criteria
creators = bot.search_creators(min_followers=5000, max_followers=50000)

# Send invitations to creators
bot.send_invitations_to_creators(creators, max_invites=20)

# Close the browser when done
bot.close()
```

    },
    "human_behavior": {
        "scroll_variance": 0.2,
        "wait_multiplier": {
            "min": 0.8,
